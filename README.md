# Python-Tutorial

Welcome to my Python tutorial repository! This project serves as a personal study guide as I revisit and practice Python programming concepts after learning from various resources, including [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/).  

## Overview  

This repository contains a collection of Python exercises, examples, and projects designed to reinforce my understanding of Python through hands-on practice. Each directory or file within the repository corresponds to different Python topics or projects.  

## Getting Started
